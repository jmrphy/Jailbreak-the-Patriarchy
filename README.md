## Jailbreak the Media Monopoly, an extension for the Google Chrome web browser
---------------
**Jailbreak the Media Monopoly** replaces the name of any media subsidiary with the name of the parent company which owns it in order to subvert the illusion of media diversity. This is a fork of Danielle Sucher's  "Jailbreak the Patriarchy," which queers a user's browsing experience by swapping gendered pronouns.

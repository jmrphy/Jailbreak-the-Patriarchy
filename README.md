## Jailbreak the Media Monopoly, an extension for Google Chrome

**Jailbreak the Media Monopoly** subverts the illusion of media diversity by replaces the name of media subsidiaries with the name of their parent corporation. This is a fork of Danielle Sucher's ["Jailbreak the Patriarchy,"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jailbreak-the-patriarchy/fiidcfoaaciclafodoficaofidfencgd?hl=en-US&gl=US) which queers the user's experience of gendered words on the web.

This currently only has a few News Corp subsidiaries as a test; I'm currently working on a scraper to build the mappings of subsidiary -> parent more efficiently...
